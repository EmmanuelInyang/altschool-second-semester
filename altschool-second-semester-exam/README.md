<h2>Cloud Engineering Second Semester Examination Project (Deploy LAMP Stack) </h2>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<ul><li>Automate the provisioning of two Ubuntu-based servers, named "Master" and "Slave", using Vagrant.</li>
<li>On the Master node, create a bash script to automate the deployment of a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack.</li>

<li>Ensure the bash script is reusable and readable.</li>
<li>Using an Ansible playbook:</li><ol>
  <li>Execute the bash script on the Slave node and verify that the PHP application is accessible through the VM's IP address (take a screenshot of this as evidence)</li>
  <li>Create a cron job to check the server's uptime every 12 a.m.</li>
</ol>
</ul>
  <br>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ol><li>Submit the bash script and Ansible playbook to (publicly accessible) GitHub repository.</li>
<li>Document the steps with screenshots in md files, including proof of the application's accessibility (screenshots taken where necessary)</li>
