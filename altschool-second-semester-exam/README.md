##Cloud Engineering Second Semester Examination Project (Deploy LAMP Stack)##

<h2>Steps</h2>

Here are the steps to run this script in an Ubuntu-based environment:

1. **Get Started:** 
   - To begin, I opened my code editor terminal.
     
2. **Create a directory:** <br>
   - I chose to name the directory "altschool-second-semester-exam" and initiated it using the following command:
      ```bash
         mkdir altschool-second-semester-exam

3. **Navigate into the directory:**
   - I then changed my working directory to the newly created "altschool-second-semester-exam" directory:
      ```bash
         cd altschool-second-semester-exam
      
4. **Create a Bash script file (master-slave-setup.sh):**
   - I proceeded to create a Bash script file using the following command:
      ```bash
         touch master-slave-setup.sh

5. **Grant the necessary permission:**
   - For the Bash script to be executable, I granted the required permission using the command:
      ```bash
         chmod +x master-slave-setup.sh

6. **Write out the contents of master-slave-setup.sh**
   - This script automates the setup of two Vagrant virtual machines (master and slave) and configures them for Ansible provisioning.
       
7. **Execute the master-slave-setup script:**
   - Next, I executed the script with the command:
     ```bash
        sh master-slave-setup.sh

**After installing the master-slave-ubuntu.sh script, the next step I took was creating a script to automate the installation of LAMP stack on the master node (VM).**
   <br>
   <br>
8. **Creating a Bash script file (master.sh)**
   - I ran the command on the terminal to create the Bash script file:
     ```bash
        sh master.sh

9. **Grant the necessary permission (master.sh)**
    - The necessary permission was granted by running the command below to make the Bash script file and executable file.
      ```bash
         chmod +x master.sh

10. **Write out the contents of master.sh**
    - This bash automates the deployment of a Laravel web application on the master virtual machine.
      
11. **Execute the master.sh script:**
      - To execute the master.sh script, I used the command:
         ```bash
            sh master.sh
      
**After the master.sh script completion, the Lamp stack installation on the master node was successful, and the Laravel GitHub repository was cloned without issues. The next step involved testing the Laravel application.**
   <br>
   <br>
   
12. **Testing the Laravel Application on the Master node:** <br>
<ul>
   <li> Access the master node via SSH using the command: `vagrant ssh master`. </li>
   <li> Retrieve the master node's IP address by executing `hostname -I` within the terminal. The second IP displayed is the correct one to use. </li>
   <li> Open your web browser and enter this IP address. </li>
   <li> You will be directed to the Laravel application's homepage. </li>
</ul>

   **Below is a screenshot of the homepage displayed in my browser:**

<br>  
<br>
**After successfully testing the Laravel Application on the master node, the next step I took was installing the same LAMP stack application on the slave node using Ansible.**
The primary difference between the master LAMP stack installation and the Slave LAMP stack installation is the utilization of Ansible for the installation on the Slave node. <br>
**NOTE:** Ansible was installed and configured on the master node when the master.sh script was executed.
<br>
<br>
13. **SSH into the Master node:**
    - I checked if I'm already on the master node from the previous task. If i'm not, I can SSH into the master node with the command: 
      ```bash
         vagrant ssh master.
         
14. **Locate the "plays" directory**
    - Once logged into the master node, I switched to the 'altschool' user by using the following command:
       ```bash
          su - altschool.
   A password prompt appeared, and I entered the password, which is 'password', as configured by the **master.sh** script. After successfully entering the password, I was logged in as     the 'AltSchool' user on the master node. Next, I navigated to the 'plays' directory with the command: cd plays. <br>
   **NOTE:** It's worth noting that during the setup process using the 'master.sh' script, Ansible was installed, and essential components like the 'Altschool' user, the 'myhosts'        file (also known as the Inventory file), and 'ansible.cfg' (Ansible configuration file) were configured.

15. **Create a Jinja2 template file**
    - In the 'plays' directory, I created a Jinja template file named 'slave.sh.j2.' Jinja templates are used to make Ansible plays involving bash scripts as dynamic as possible.

16. **Write out the contents for slave.sh.j2**
    - This bash automates the deployment of a Laravel web application on the slave virtual machine.

17. **Create an Ansible playbook file (ansible-playbook.yml)**
    - Within the 'plays' directory, I also created an Ansible playbook file named 'ansible-playbook.yml.' In this file, I defined the Ansible play required to perform the LAMP stack         installation using the 'slave.sh.j2' file and other required tasks. The other tasks involved creating a cron job on the slave node to run at midnight (12AM).
      To create the file, I ran the command:
         ```bash
            mkdir ansible-playbook.yml

18. **Grant the necessary permission (ansible-playbook.yml)**
    - In order for the ansible-playbook.yml file to be an executable, I ran the command:
         ```bash
            chmod +x master.sh

19. **Execute the Ansible file (ansible-playbook.yml)**
    - To execute the ansible-playbook.yml file, I used this command:
         ```bash
            ansible-playbook ansible-playbook,yml
         ``` 
       **Note** The first ansible-playbook is the command, and the second one is the name of the ansible playbook to run.

20. **Testing the Ansible playbook (ansible-playbook.yml)and the jinja template (slave.sh.j2)**
    - To ensure the successful execution of the tasks, I performed testing. Using the IP address obtained from the slave node by logging into the slave node and running the
      `hostname -I` command, I accessed the Laravel homepage by entering the slave's IP address in the web browser.
    
**Below, you'll find a screenshot of the Laravel homepage with the slave VM's IP address:**
