<h2>Cloud Engineering Second Semester Examination Project (Deploy LAMP Stack) </h2>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<ul><li>Automate the provisioning of two Ubuntu-based servers, named "Master" and "Slave", using Vagrant.</li>
<li>On the Master node, create a bash script to automate the deployment of a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack.</li>

<li>Ensure the bash script is reusable and readable.</li>
<li>Using an Ansible playbook:</li><ol>
  <li>Execute the bash script on the Slave node and verify that the PHP application is accessible through the VM's IP address (take a screenshot of this as evidence)</li>
