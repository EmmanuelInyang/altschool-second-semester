<h2>Cloud Engineering Second Semester Examination Project (Deploy LAMP Stack)</h2>

<h2>Steps</h2>

Here are the steps to run this script in an Ubuntu-based environment:

1. **Get Started:** 
   - To begin, I opened my code editor terminal.
     
2. **Create a directory:** <br>
   - I chose to name the directory "altschool-second-semester-exam" and initiated it using the following command:
      ```bash
         mkdir altschool-second-semester-exam

3. **Navigate into the directory:**
   - I then changed my working directory to the newly created "altschool-second-semester-exam" directory:
      ```bash
         cd altschool-second-semester-exam
      
4. **Create a Bash script file (master-slave-setup.sh):**
   - I proceeded to create a Bash script file using the following command:
      ```bash
         touch master-slave-setup.sh

5. **Grant the necessary permission:**
   - For the Bash script to be executable, I granted the required permission using the command:
      ```bash
         chmod +x master-slave-setup.sh

6. **Write out the contents of master-slave-setup.sh**
   - This script automates the setup of two Vagrant virtual machines (master and slave) and configures them for Ansible provisioning.
       
7. **Execute the master-slave-setup script:**
   - Next, I executed the script with the command:
     ```bash
        sh master-slave-setup.sh
   <br>
   
**After installing the master-slave-ubuntu.sh script, the next step I took was creating a script to automate the installation of LAMP stack on the master node (VM).**
8. **Creating a Bash script file (master.sh)**
   - I ran the command on the terminal to create the Bash script file:
     ```bash
        sh master.sh

9. **Grant the necessary permission**
    - The necessary permission was granted by running the command below to make the Bash script file and executable file.
      ```bash
         chmod +x master-slave-setup.sh

10. **Write out the contents of master.sh**
    - This bash automates the deployment of a Laravel web application on the master virtual machine.
      
11. **Execute the master.sh script:**
   - To execute the master.sh script, I used the command:
      ```bash
         sh master.sh
<br>

**After the master.sh script completion, the Lamp stack installation on the master node was successful, and the Laravel GitHub repository was cloned without issues. The subsequent step involved testing the Laravel application.**

8. **Testing the Laravel Application on the Master node:**
   - Access the master node via SSH using the command: `vagrant ssh master`.
   - Retrieve the master node's IP address by executing `hostname -I` within the terminal. The second IP displayed is the correct one to         use.
   - Open your web browser and enter this IP address.
   - You will be directed to the Laravel application's homepage.
