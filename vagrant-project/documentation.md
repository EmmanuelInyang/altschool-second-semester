## Vagrant LAMP Stack Deployment

<p>This script automates the setup and deployment of a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack on two Vagrant virtual machines, referred to as the "Master" and "Slave" nodes. To accomplish this, It performs the following steps:</p>

   - Configure the Vagrantfile with the defined VM settings.
   - Create and provision the Master and Slave VMs.
   - Configure user accounts and generate SSH key pairs.
   - Copy SSH keys between nodes for passwordless SSH.
   - Set up directories for data synchronization.
   - Synchronize data from the Master to the Slave using rsync.
   - Install and configure a LAMP stack on both nodes.
   - Create a PHP info file for testing the setup.
   - Display process information on the Master node.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed.
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed.
- Basic knowledge of Linux, as this script involves user creation, SSH setup, and Linux server provisioning.

## Usage

1. **Clone Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Configure Variables:** Edit the script's variables at the beginning to match your desired configuration. These variables define VM names, users, and directories.

   - `box_name`: Set the name of the Vagrant box.
   - `master_vm`: Name of the Master node.
   - `slave_vm`: Name of the Slave node.
   - `master_user`: User name for the Master node.
   - `slave_user`: User name for the Slave node.
   - `vb_memory`: Amount of memory allocated to the VMs.
   - `slave_target_dir`: Target directory on the Slave node for data synchronization.
   - `master_target_dir`: Source directory on the Master node for data synchronization.

3. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   sh vagrant-ubuntu.sh

4. **Test LAMP Setup** After running the script, you can access the PHP test file on both the Master and Slave nodes. Use the IP addresses displayed during the script execution to access the PHP test file.

   - Master node PHP test: http://$master_ip/test-php-file.php
   - Slave node PHP test: http://$slave_ip/test-php-file.php
